                    <p>The Akan are a meta-ethnicity predominantly speaking Central Tano languages and residing in the southern regions of the former Gold Coast region in what is today the nation of Ghana. Akans who historically migrated from Ghana also
                        make up a plurality of the populace in the Ivory Coast. The Akan language (also known as Twi/Fante) is a group of dialects within the Central Tano branch of the Potou–Tano subfamily of the Niger–Congo family.
                    </p>
                    <p1>The Akan people are believed to have migrated from the Sahel region and the savannas of West Africa. Between the 15th and 19th century, they dominated trading and gold mines in the region, and by the 17th century, they were already
                        among the most influential communities in Africa. They dominated the goldfields between the Volta and Komoe Rivers where they mined the precious metal and traded it with other local communities or traders from overseas. The gold
                        attracted the Dutch who were later joined by the British. The Europeans quickly realized that the Akan was a strong group and opted for diplomacy instead of armed colonialism. They employed the Akan warriors to invade their neighbors
                        for slaves who were sold in exchange for guns. Between 1820 and 1900, the Ashanti engaged the Europeans in armed conflicts as the latter tried severally to colonize the Ashanti Kingdom. By the early 1900s, the French had colonized
                        Ivory Coast while the British had colonized Ghana.
                    </p1>
                    <p2>In March 1957, Ghana gained independence, and three years later the Ivory Coast followed suit.The Akan are a religious group of people. They adopted Christianity as their primary religion, but others identify as Muslims. The Ancient
                        Akan people worshipped Onyame (Supreme God), Asase Yaa (the goddess of the earth), and to their ancestors by offering sacrifices including slaves. The Akan maintained the traditional matrilineal cultures where the kingship lineage
                        is dependent on women.

                    <p>Akan conflicts led to a high number of military captives being sold into slavery known as "Coromantee". These Coromantee soldiers and other Akan captives were notorious for a large number of slave revolts and plantation resistance
                        tactics. These captives were feared throughout the Americas so much so that we can see their legacy within groups such as the Maroons of the Caribbean and South America.

                    <p>Akan culture can also be found in the New World.A number of Akans were taken as captives to the Americas. Roughly ten-percent of all slave ships embarked from the Gold Coast. The primary source of wealth within Akan economy was gold.
                        However as wars culminate in the region the capture and sale of Akan people peaked during the Fante and Ashanti conflicts (as both sides sold a large number of their captives) as prisoners of war.
                    </p>
                    <p1>Each subgroup of the Akan is ruled by a king who is chosen from the royal line of the Kingdom. The king is chosen by various officials of the tribe and must receive the blessings of the “queen-mother” who is not the actual mother of
                        the king but a senior woman of the tribe. Political structures exist for cultural reasons only since have been superseded by the federal administration.</p1>

                <p>Beliefs regarding fertility and infertility are similar in Akan culture, and that such a culture may serve as a bridge between a Western context, in which infertility is not viewed so tragically, and the original ANE context, in which
                    infertility is a shameful and tragic condition. The examination of infertility in Akan may help to further highlight the situation and solutions sought by women in the Hebrew narratives. The word “wom(b)an” is useful to underscore
                    the centrality of the womb to a woman’s identity in Akan culture.</p>
                <p2>Abusua (family) in the Akan group of Ghana is reckoned through matrilineal descent. In such a context, a childless woman is pitiable. There is a Twi proverb “wunni ba a, due,” which means if a woman does not have a child she is to be consoled.1
                    Not only is the barren woman pitied because of her individual experience but also she is pitied as one who is regarded to be a threat to the continuity of the family and larger community.Akan society is traditionally oral in nature.
                    Proverbs are not only used to communicate truth but also to reinforce valued behaviour and discourage negative behaviour, known as taboos. In this culture, proverbs concerning children emphasise the centrality of childbirth and the
                    shame of infertility. In the present chapter, several proverbs will be explored which underscore such beliefs</p2>
